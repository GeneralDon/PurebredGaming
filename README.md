# PurebredGaming
A manufacturing company which designs and builds unique desktop computers from premium hardwoods.

  To-Do: 
 * Update business name across all pages
 * Add "Buy" page: initially (before introducing Model 2/PG 18/whatever) have main image of product at top of page,         dropdowns/checkboxes for features? After introducing second model, have a prior page listing the different models.
 * Get real forms rather than using Google forms across everything. Need to get back to me somehow, so contact could go to one email then support another, etc.
 * Still need a merchant service
 * Also need a hosting service, BlueHost? Not sure who's good anymore for static pages
 * Sell something, hopefully
 * Profit?
